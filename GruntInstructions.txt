Welcome to Grunt!



Don't worry, it's all very easy.


First of all make sure you have installed node.js - http://nodejs.org/
Next install grunt - http://gruntjs.com/getting-started


That's the setup! Everything you need is now installed, piece of cake.


In order to get it to work for this project you just have to open the "Sell My Gadgets" folder in terminal (or command prompt I guess).

Got that?

Then type: grunt

Boom.


If you'd like it to do all the tasks automatically just type: grunt auto

While running grunt auto it also sets up live reload, all you need is the browser extension from - http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-

Install that and just click the button to enable it.
